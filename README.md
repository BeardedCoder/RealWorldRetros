## Real World Retro Techniques
 
###Dominant Speaker
* Try [dot voting](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html) to select a topic 
* Then use small group work with the goal of each group creating an actionable item to report back.
* Or try questions like *What other ideas haven't we heard yet?*

###Leader stifles conversation
* You can try having a leadership-free retro
* As the scrum master you can *be a mirror* and provide feedback to the manager

###Quiet People
* Use Post-it notes to get contributions from everyone
* At the start of retro have everyone describes the sprint with one word
  * Research shows that people who speak early are more likely to contribute to the meeting 

###Negative Retro
* Have a [Positive (or Appreciative) Retrospective](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Appreciative_Retrospective) where you don't allow negative talk
  * And not “we’re really awesome at sucking”
* Try asking the question “what can we do to change this situation” 
* Ask people to replace the word **can't** with the phrase **I could do that, if ...**
* Use [Circles and Soup](http://www.innovationgames.com/circles-and-soup/)

###Too Many Ideas!
* Try using an [Affinity Map](http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/idea-creation-tools/overview/affinity.html)
* Or try a 2x2 decision matrix
  * Using effort verses payoff
  * Things that are low effort and high payoff should be tackled first

###New People Don’t Talk
* Senior team members have lots to say and new members are quiet and don’t contribute
* Call out that all opinions are valid at beginning
* You can try directly asking people for their thoughts
  * If you are attentive, you can see when people *wish* they could speak
* Using Post-it notes and small groups works well here

###Story Time Retro (all talk...no walk)
* At the start state that the goal is to leave with 1 actionable item for next sprint

## Other Ideas and Resources

###Retr-o-Mat

This is a great [site](http://www.plans-for-retrospectives.com/) that helps you plan your next retrospective (I'm not even going to try to describe it, just check it out)

###de Bono's 6 Thinking Hats

* [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats)
* A couple of retrospective plans using the 6 Thinking Hats
  * [Rob Bowley - 6 Thinking Hats Retrospective Plan](http://blog.robbowley.net/2009/08/29/6-thinking-hats-retrospective-plan/)
  * [Agility Personified - Retrospective Using Six Thinking Hats Technique](http://agilecruiser.blogspot.ca/2009/11/retrospective-using-six-thinking-hats.html)

###Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives

An excellent book that contains many ideas and tools for use in your retrospectives ([download](https://leanpub.com/gettingvalueoutofagileretrospectives))

## An Awesome Retro Example (that we've done before)
1. Start by having the team create a list of possible topics
2. Provide a few minutes for clarifications
3. The team [dot votes](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html) to select the items they want to discuss
4. Use [Lean Coffee](http://www.rallydev.com/community/agile/lean-coffee-staff-meetings) as the discussion model
5. The Scrum Master listens and intervenes to identify actionable items and directs a thumb vote
  * Thumbs up means *I agree*, sideways means *I have an amendment*, down means *Disagree, but have a counter-proposal*
